Warning! This is a modified version of Apache Rivet 3.1.1
It was modified to allow installing on CentOS 7. Thus, it may work improperly
on other systems. CentOS 7 uses quite obsolete versions of required dependencies.
It's strongly recommended to use original sources on other systems with up-to-date dependencies
(e.g., Debian Jessie+). The performance of this version is slightly lower.

See INSTALL for brief installation instructions - although the above
docs in HTML are more thorough and extensive.

			    KNOWN PROBLEMS
			    ==============


 - Rivet is reported to conflict with cgi scripts on some Linux machines.
Symptom of the problem is when cgi scripts hang forever and don't send contents
to the client

 
			    RIVET NAMESPACE
			    ===============

 - With the intruduction of the ::rivet namespace the command set has been
moved into it and each command should now be fully qualified. 
Building rivet you can choose in case to place the commands on the export 
list or even automatically import them into the global namespace. This
is a deprecated option though unless you have a compatibility issue
with existing legacy Rivet based code.
